# Coding Conventions

## HTML, CSS, JS

    - Tab size: 4 spaces
    - Lines less than 100 characters
    - pascalCase
    - Same line curly braces
    - Every function is documented, summary for complex files and funcctions with additional comments for complex logic, present tense
    - Include examples in comments for complex functions
    - Code is as self-documented as possible
    - Avoid hard-coded values, use variables for constants

## Git

    - Feature branch for every feature, merge that into staging/development branch, approved by someone other than you
    - Merging into main requiring two approvals
    - Commit early and often, every commit does one thing
    - Commit messages should mention what the commit is for, then add details in description/body, present tense
    - Make github issues for every single thing we do

# Roadmap

1. Within a weekend:
    - Start with setting up GitHub and environment to include linter and tests and whatever
    - Have *one* person create a wireframe that includes all the necessary boilerplate and skeleton
2. Within a week (or maybe two):
    - Split into subteams
    - One subteam: Get plain text editing functionality early on
    - Another subteam: Start working on search
    - Final Subteam: start working on Sidebar
    - Making sure to document everything/add tests in the meantime
3. Within three weeks (or maybe four):
    - Editor subteam gets markdown support
    - Search subteam finishes search and results
    - Final subteam finishes sidebar + calendar + tags
4. Everyone work on improving CSS (overall polish + bug fixes) to become more uniform (within 4 or 5 weeks)
5. Add additional features if time (within 6 weeks)

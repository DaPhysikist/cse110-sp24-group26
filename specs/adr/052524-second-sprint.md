# Second Sprint

## Context and Problem Statement

For the second sprint, we need to finalize a few design details before we can implement all of our features. We will also need to consider integration of the components.

## Considered Options

Rendering Editor Markdown: Separate Panes

Rendering Editor Markdown: Style text as it is edited

Renaming Tags: Double Click

Renaming Tags: Right Click

Choosing Future Days on Calendar: Forbid

Choosing Future Days on Calendar: Allow

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option for rendering editor markdown: "Style text as it is edited", because it is more space efficient and simpler.

Chosen option for renaming tags: "Right Click", because discerning between a single and double left click will be much harder compared to just using a right click.

Chosen option for choosing days on calendar: "Allow", because there is not much reason not to, and the user may have a reason for it.

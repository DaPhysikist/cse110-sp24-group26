# Optional Features We Could Not Implement

## Context and Problem Statement

There were a list of non-essential features that came up during our brainstorm period.
We need to decide on what features to implement in the final product as we approach the final deadline.

## Considered Options

* Dark theme support
* Toggle Bar
* Editor Tools
* Image support

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option for Dark theme support: "No Dark Theme support", because our current styling both effective and  sufficient.

Chosen option for code Toggle Bar: "No Toggle Bar", because this would have been integrated with dark theme support which we decided to not implement.

Chosen option for Editor Tools: "No Editor Tools", because the core functionality of the text editor was already implemented so we could sacrifice these tools in order to focus on more detailed testing and documentation regarding the core editor itself.

Chosen option for Image support: "No Image support", because it would have proven to be a significant challenge to develop with the limited time we had left.

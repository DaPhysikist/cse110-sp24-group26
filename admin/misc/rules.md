## Primary Means of Communication:
We will primarily communicate on Slack. In terms of response rates, on weekdays responding by the end of the day would be preferred (so long as it is not too late), and on weekends more tolerance is given. Pay special attention to pings (i.e. turn notifications on).

## Meetings
Meetings will take place every Friday at 6:00 - 7:00 PM (subject to change) over Zoom. We will rotate facilitators to make sure everyone has a chance to speak.
During meetings (and possibly outside of them), members should deliver regular progress updates

## General Responsibilities: 
Participate in meetings and make sure the team is up to date beforehand about any special circumstances that means you would be unable to contribute for that week. Pay special attention to tasks assigned to you, and likewise communicate explicitly beforehand if you feel you might not be able to finish them.
Unless otherwise stated, assume that you must finish assignments 24 hours before the deadline so that it is easier to coordinate.

Follow the rules of development outlined in the kickoff meeting (treat people with respect, be open and constructive, have patience, stay accountable, ask questions and help, communicate often, donâ€™t make large decisions without consenting others, ensure everyone has a platform to speak).
Speak out about any doubts; don't keep them to yourself and then say "I knew it" or "I told you so"
Don't be afraid to ask questions/speak up!

## Specific Responsibilities: 
As of now, the only thing is that Jason and the facilitator of the next meeting will have to coordinate on setting up the agenda. We may add more specific responsibilities in the future, but in general if you do the tasks assigned to you in the meeting on time, that should be more than enough.

## Conflict Resolution: 
Discuss things peacefully and at no time should insults be sent to another team member. If the need arises, conflicts will generally be handled by a third party member of the group. It is expected that once a resolution is reached, everyone will work whole-heartedly to work towards the resolution (i.e. even if your idea was not chosen, you should still follow along with what the group decides)
Be communicative, open, and accepting when it comes to disagreements, as in don't be afraid to speak your mind whenever the thought arises and try to appreciate and understand the perspectives of those disagreeing with you. Obviously be constructive and productive with it too
Under no circumstances should any team member dismiss a member's idea or say an idea is dumb

## Expectations of Faculty: 
Should a team member fail to live up to expectations of this agreement, we will first use the conflict resolution strategy described in 6. In the unexpected circumstance that this too is not working, we may contact staff or persons outside of the team to help resolve the situation.
If there is an offender/s not upholding the agreement we could try addressing them privately one-on-one at first and then addressing it during a group meeting if it continues. If the contract offender shares confidential information to a member, permission must be obtained from them before sharing the situation with the team.
The person who should be conducting the 1on1s should be the team lead.

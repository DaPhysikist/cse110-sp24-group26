## Agenda Items

- **Decide on team structure for dividing up work**
   - We decided to do pairing/triples to break up task efficiently and to have accountability
  - **Five basic features - one per pair/triple**
    - Calendar minimap - feature 1  - 2 people
    - Search + database - feature 2 - 3 people
    - Tags and categories - feature 3  - 2 people
    - Creating entries themselves/the editor, with the basic text and markdown supported, light/dark - feature 4 - 3 people
- **Determine standup frequency - every 2/3 days, or when major progress is made**
- **Determine structure of project design** 
  - plan to develop a skeleton of the product, then build out each feature using branches - use standups to keep teamemmbers updated to make integration easier
    - Depending on progress, may need to repeat this a few times, where changes are merged in, product is viewed as a whole, then iterative build out happens again

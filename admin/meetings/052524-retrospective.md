## Agenda Items

### Retrospective

- What to Improve:
  - Going a biy below pace, integrating things a bti faster, but we can catch up pretty easily
  - Integration even though it's conceptually simple, will get messy, especially with styling
  - Haven't gone over fine details on how the different feature teams will come together for the final product
  - Make a markdwn file for a feature later on to explain its functionality at a high level.
  - Some teams aren't communicating with each other that much, at the very least tell each other what you're doing, your progress, what you guys need to work on, your approaches
  - Talk more and plan in the beginning
  - How different parts of the app are going to communicate with each other
  - Integration:
    - Message-based, calendar publishes an open tab event, tab opens a tab, editor opens cotnent, tags update which are toggled
    - Clicking another tab also publishes another open tab event, and calendar will also change the current highlighted date
    - Changing a tag updates the database, possibly, the tab list and calendar date can reflect these tag changes
